This repository contains assets for OpenArm v1 (above) and v0.3 (below) simulation in MuJoCo. 

## Usage

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/814ee3e1-36dd-4561-a837-25e921838253

1. Install MuJoCo and launch a simulation.
2. Drag the `*.xml` file into the simulation window.

The motors use torque control, so position and velocity control can be achieved by implementing a simple PD controller in client code.

## Collision Visualization
- To view collision meshes, activate `Rendering`>`Model Elements`>`Convex Hull` and `Group Enable`>`Geom groups`>`Geom 3` in the left sidebar
- It may also help to hide the visual meshes by deselecting `Geom 2`

## ROS2 Hardware Interface

MuJoCo can be used to simulate realistic hardware interfaces to test low-frequency control without physical hardware.

## URDF to MJCF Conversion
- Grippers actuate equally using a tendon and equality constraint, which uses a mimic joint in URDF
- Off-diagonal inertias are set to zero
- Motors require `ctrlrange` limits and joints have additional runtime properties `damping` and `frictionloss`
